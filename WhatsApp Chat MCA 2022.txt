Can anyone provide me notes ?
15/10/22, 16:38 - HIRA SIR added +91 70789 74222
15/10/22, 21:27 - HIRA SIR: 1. Ideas mean nothing. Zero. Zilch Execution is the only thing that matters. It's not what you thought about doing, it's about what you did.

2. DO NOT WATCH P#@N. It kills your energy. It numbs your ability to feel. It's a life killer.

3. Never let anyone get comfortable with disrespecting you.

4. Be selfish with your time. A lot of people don't deserve it.

5. Share your progress, not your goals, and you'll always be motivated.

6. Every second you spend comparing your life to someone else's is a second spent wasting yours: so stop comparing and create your own definition of success instead.

7. Smile often. Smile so many others think you exist in a World of optimism and positivity. Because you do.

8. You grow rich when you seek new experiences, not material things.

9. Learn to say NO, Respect your time & energy. Don't be so nice that you "yes man" yourself into not having space or time for yourself.

10. There's a difference between being patient and wasting your time.

11. You spend your entire life inside of your head, making it a nice place to be.

12. In today's digital-first world, the greatest skill you can leverage is the power of focused attention, and the way to build it is through daily meditation.

13. You have to believe in yourself before anyone else does. That's the cornerstone upon which real confidence is built.

14. If you can't find a good person, be one.

15. Stay curious, question everything, and if you want something, ask for it.

16. Consistency > Intensity.

17. The life you experience is simply a reflection of your mindset.

18. You don't only live once; you live multiple lives within one.

19. Master your emotions. A calm mind can handle every storm.

20. Don't be lazy. Do the work. You won't grow from easy.

21. You will never lose, if you never quit.

22. There's a big difference between people who are smart and people who get good grades.

23. Money comes and money goes in life, but time only moves in one direction.

24. Accept people for who they are & not whom you want them to be.

25. Keep your standings high and don't settle for something because it's available.

26. Never expect to get back what you give or you will always be disappointed.

27. The best revenge is no revenge. Improve yourself and forget they exist.

01/01/23, 14:16 - HIRA SIR: Dear Ones, 
I forward my best wishes on this New Year 2023 and wish that may you change your direction and not dates, change your commitments and not the calendar, change your attitude and not the actions, and bring about a change in your faith, your force, and your focus and not the fruit. May you live up to the promises you have made and may you create for you and your loved ones the happiest New Year ever. May this year become more sweeter for everyone. Happy New Year.
Director
